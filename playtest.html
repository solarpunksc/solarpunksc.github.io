								<h2>GUIDELINES FOR REINSCRIPTION of our STRUGGLE FOR UTOPIA</h2>
								<p>As transcribed from The Free Earth Archive by the delegates to the Assembly for the Future</p>
								<div class="spotlight"><span class="image"><img src="images/Ancient Future-Retroistic Data Storage Device.png" alt="Ancestor Card back">
								<span>Fig. 1. The Free Earth Archive, 02025. Passed down to us by our Ancestors, this archive documents humanity’s legacies of freedom. The Archive is an example of an extremely durable diamond-obsidian composite cold-storage technology characteristic of the early 21st century utopians.</span>
								<p style="text-align: left">[Excerpts from the Technical Manual to The Free Earth Archive]<br/><br/>

								Living now, in our free society, we must honor our Ancestors for their struggle. This is not just an ethical imperative, but the only practical method for maintaining our utopia. The struggle for utopia is a continuous process that demands — from any so bold as to fight for it — a memory of the joys and despairs our Ancestors found...<br/><br/>

								The following three techniques are designed to facilitate conversations. They allow future generations to remember, learn, and participate in humanity’s legacy of freedom. Through these techniques, The Free Earth Archive grows as it is reinscribed.<br/><br/>

								There is a reason Technique 001 is a Festival — freedom is a struggle, but it is also a joy. Struggle in joyful solidarity for utopia.<br/>Good Luck!
								</p></div>
								
								<h2>Technique 001: Festival of Remembarance</h2>
								<p>You have been chosen as members of this year’s Assembly for the Future. Your sacred task is to lead the opening of the Festival of Remembrance where you collectively remember how each of your Ancestors came together to overcome the Challenges of the world before. The Assembly must project your minds backward into one of the many pivotal moments in our legacy of freedom to secure the utopia we’ve won.</p>
								<p class="bold">The goal of this technique is to collectively “remember” one of the many stories that grew into our utopia.<br/><br/>
								This technique has four phases:<ol>
									<li>The Ancestors</li>
									<li>The Challenge</li>
									<li>Building the New World</li>  
									<li>Remembrance</li></ol>
								</p>
								<p class="content">
									<span class="bold">01. THE ANCESTORS</span><br/>
									Our Ancestors are the reason we are here. The festival is designed to honor and reinscribe their struggle.<br/><br/>

									<strong>Each Assembly Member draws one Ancestor and one Value card.</strong><br/></br>

									Each Assembly Member remembers an Ancestor and the Values that guided them. <br/></br>

									<strong>Set a two-minute timer to write down each Ancestors’ details.</strong><br/></br>

									Remember each Ancestor’s name, brief background, and what motivated them to struggle for a better world.<br/></br>

									<strong>When the timer is up, someone begins by introducing their Ancestor.</strong>
									<br/></br>

									<span class="bold">02. THE CHALLENGE</span><br/>
									Our festival names one of the Challenges of the world before. None of them were easy to overcome.

									<strong>Draw one Challenge card as a group. Explain why it was so daunting and how it conflicted with each Ancestor’s Value.</strong>

									Any Member begins by stating, “When we overcame the Challenge of _____, I remember …” Everyone goes around the circle collectively describing the nature of the Challenge, why it was so daunting and how it ran counter to each Ancestor’s Value.<br/><br/>
									
									<span class="bold">03. BUILDING THE NEW WORLD</span><br/>
									Success was not immediate. Utopia requires struggle and adaptability. Every Ancestor started somewhere.<br/><br/>

									<strong>Each Assembly Member remembers the Tools their Ancestors brought along or created along the way.</strong>

									Use your imagination to write how each Ancestor initially approached the Challenge. Since they won’t fully overcome the challenge until the next phase, be sure to think about where they came up short and/or which powers opposed them.

									<strong>Set a 5-minute timer to write down each Ancestor’s details.</strong>

									The following questions can help guide you:<ul>
										<li>Did your Ancestor first try to mitigate or fight the challenge indirectly?</li>
										<li>Was there a moment when they understood a key truth about the Challenge?</li>
										<li>What powers opposed them and how?</li>
										<li>In what ways did the Ancestor succeed? In what ways did they come up short?</li>
									</ul>
									<br/><br/>

									<span class="bold">04. REMEMBRANCE</span><br/>
									Together, we weave each of our Ancestors’ narrative threads into the tapestry that built this part of our utopia. This is the culmination of the Festival of Remembrance.<br/><br/>

									<strong>Collectively tell the story of what roadblocks they encountered and how the Ancestors came together to overcome the challenge.</strong><br/><br/>
									<span class="column-list">
										How did the Ancestors collaborate with one another to overcome the challenge?<br/>
										What was a key decision the Ancestors made together?<br/>
										How did those responsible for perpetuating the Challenge counter the Ancestors’ efforts?<br/>
										How did the world look after the Ancestors’ intervention?<br/>
									</span><br/><br/>
									<strong>This phase ends when someone declares, “We honor our Ancestors for their struggle.” The group uses Modified Consensus to decide if they have overcome the Challenge.</strong>
